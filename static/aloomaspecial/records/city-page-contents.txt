These tiny, reddish-brown insects feed on human blood, leaving itchy bite marks and exacerbating allergic reactions in some individuals. Early identification and prompt treatment are crucial to effectively combat bed bug infestations.

Identifying bed bug infestations can be challenging, as these pests are adept at hiding in cracks, crevices, and tight spaces.
